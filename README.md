# Story Game 

Welcome to the Story Game! In this project, you'll be creating a simple text-based adventure game where players can choose a character class and make decisions that lead to different outcomes in the story. Follow the steps below to get the game up and running.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.

## Task 1: Set Up Character Classes

In this task, you'll define character classes that inherit from the base `Character` class.

1. Open the `main.py` file in your preferred code editor.
2. Find the `Character` class definition and make sure it's correctly implemented.

## Task 2: Define Warrior and Mage Classes

1. Implement the `Warrior` class, inheriting from the `Character` class.
2. Implement the `Mage` class, inheriting from the `Character` class.
3. Test the `Warrior` and `Mage` classes by creating instances and printing their attributes.

## Task 3: Create the StoryGame Class

Here, you'll implement the `StoryGame` class responsible for running the game.

1. Implement the `StoryGame` class with its constructor and initial attributes.
2. Define the `start` method to allow players to choose their character class and name.
3. Implement the `play` method to manage the game loop and player choices.
4. Implement the `explore_forest`, `enter_cave`, and `return_to_village` methods for different story events.
5. Define the `battle` method to handle combat with enemies.

## Task 4: Implement the Main Part

1. Create an instance of the `StoryGame` class.
2. Call the `start` method to begin the game.

## Task 5: Test the Game

1. Run the `main.py` script.
2. Follow the prompts to choose a character class, make decisions, and engage in battles.

## Task 6: Enhancements (Optional)

Once the basic functionality is working, you can consider adding enhancements to the game, such as:

- Introducing more story events.
- Implementing different enemy types with varying attributes.
- Adding items, spells, or special abilities.
- Incorporating a scoring system or achievements.

## Task 7: Refactoring and Improvements (Optional)

As you work on the game, you might want to refactor your code for better organization and readability. Additionally, you can improve the user experience by providing clearer instructions and options.
